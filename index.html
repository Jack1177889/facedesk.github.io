    <h2>Annual Federal Inspection</h2>
    <div class="item"><img src="img/1116171953_resized.jpg"></div>
    <p>On February 21st, 1996, SJNMA held a Federal Inspection. SJNMA's Honor Unit with Distinction represent's St. John's exceptionalism. They only lost 9 points. Inspected by military staff on campus. This inspection is day long. They inspect march-ins, hallways, uniforms, uniformity, rooms. This always stresses students out, but the SJNMA Corp of Cadets once again proved why they were Honor Unit with Distinction.</p>

    <div class="item"><img src="img/1114170924_resized.jpg"></div>
    <p>Ralph Spanjer 'Smoke', became SJNMA president in 1994. Some of his ideas included merging NMNA and SJMA, enrolling 7th and 8th graders into the school so they could learn good habits from the older cadets. This would hopefully increase enrollment to 400 by the year 2000. U.S. President Bush came to SJNMA where he was presented by Spanjer's cadets. He stepped down to the Chancellor role in 1998.</p>

    <p>There used to be another company other than the one we have now. It was a
    car corps, but they were disbanded shortly after WWII.
    The car corps consisted of multiple cars that were all made
    by Royal Page Davidson. (Born: October 9, 1870; Died January 16, 1943) he made
    many different types of armored cars and had gone on extensive trips in said
    cars. He had made cadillacs into ballon destroyers with 50 cal brownings on
    them that  could swivel horizontal and verticaly 180 degrees.
    One time, when he was driving these cars, he ran into a man who was forcing 
    all of the cars on the road go through a ditch that he dug because he hated 
    cars. But when the man saw NMNA driving their cars he let them drive around
    the ditch because he was scared of the guns mounted on their cars.</p>
   </div>
   <div class = "col-sm-6">
    <p>One of Corporal Davidson's most famous cars was his Cadillac Balloon
    Destroyer. He took the frame and engine of a Cadillac and added extensive 
    parts, like a 50 cal browning
    that had been able to move
    vertical and horizontal, 180 degrees, which had
    made that a good reason to get them.
    The army had even started to enlist these vehicles
    during WWII because of how great
    they were wityh tracking on hard terrain. Sadly
    Corporal wasn't able to see this because he had passed away in 1943.</p>

   <div class = "col-sm-3">
    <h4>1894 Class Stone</h4>
    <p>As one of the oldest recorded class stones in this schools
    history, it's not surprising that it would have gone missing. We don't have many
    clue as to its location, but here is what we do have:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The ceremony was held under rustling trees</li>
    <li>The other class stones around this year are located in the middle, grassy
    area of campus</li>
    <li>Stones around this time period were also basic and square shaped, so this
    one may be the same.</li>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <div class = "col-sm-3">
    <h4>1895 Class Stone</h4>
    <p>Just like 1894's stone, there aren't many clues towards its location, but here is what we do know:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The ceremony was held next to tall trees</li>
    <li>Just like before, the other class stones around this time period are located in the middle of campus</li>
    <li>Also like before, this stone may be square shaped as well.</li>

    <h4>Class Stone Photo?</h4>
    <div class = "item"> <img src = "img/IMG_1860.JPG"></div>
    <p>If you look past the fence you can see a strange
    object. Could this be a class stone? Stone from around this time period are 
    located near Smythe Hall. Now you may ask "If it's a class stone, then
    shouldn't it be covered in snow?" Well normally it should be, class stones
    were more respected back then, so there's a chance that maybe people would
    wipe snow off of the stones. But this is all just speculation. Your guess is
    as good as mine.</p>

    <h4>1899 Class Stone</h4>

    <p>I found this photo while looking for the two
    lost stones. I thought it was funny how the ball fell off of the stone.</p>
