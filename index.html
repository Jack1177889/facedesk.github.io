  <div class="item"><p>On February 21st, 1996, SJNMA held a Federal Inspection. SJNMA's Honor Unit with Distinction represent's St. John's exceptionalism. They only lost 9 points. Inspected by military staff on campus. This inspection is day long. They inspect march-ins, hallways, uniforms, uniformity, rooms. This always stresses students out, but the SJNMA Corp of Cadets once again proved why they were Honor Unit with Distinction.</p></div>

  <div class="item"><img src="1114170924_resized.jpg"></div>
  <div class="item"><p>Ralph Spanjer 'Smoke', became SJNMA president in 1994. Some of his ideas included merging NMNA and SJMA, enrolling 7th and 8th graders into the school so they could learn good habits from the older cadets. This would hopefully increase enrollment to 400 by the year 2000. U.S. President Bush came to SJNMA where he was presented by Spanjer's cadets. He stepped down to the Chancellor role in 1998.</p></div>

	<h1>1894 Class Stone</h1>
	<div class = "item"></div>
	<div class = "item"><p>As one of the oldest recorded class stones in this schools
history, it's not surprising that it would have gone missing. We don't have many
clue as to its location, but here is what we do have:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>The ceremony was held under rustling trees</li>
<li>The other class stones around this year are located in the middle, grassy
area of campus</li>
<li>Stones around this time period were also basic and square shaped, so this
one may be the same.</li>
</ul>

 <div class= "artifact2">
	<h1>1895 Class Stone</h1>
	<div class = "item"></div>
	<div class = "item"><p>Just like 1894's stone, there aren't many clues towards its location, but here is what we do know:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>The ceremony was held next to tall trees</li>
<li>Just like before, the other class stones around this time period are located in the middle of campus</li>
<li>Also like before, this stone may be square shaped as well.</li>

	<h1>Class Stone Photo?</h1>
	<div class = "item"> <img src = "IMG_1860.jpg"></div>
	<div class = "item"><p>If you look past the fence you can see a strange
object. Could this be a class stone? Stone from around this time period are 
located near Smythe Hall. Now you may ask "If it's a class stone, then
shouldn't it be covered in snow?" Well normally it should be, class stones
were more respected back then, so there's a chance that maybe people would
wipe snow off of the stones. But this is all just speculation. Your guess is
as good as mine.</p></div>
