	<h1>1894 Class Stone</h1>
	<div class = "item"></div>
	<div class ="item"><p>As one of the oldest recorded class stones in this schools
history, it's not surprising that it would have gone missing. We don't have many
clue as to its location, but here is what we do have:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>The ceremony was held under "rustling trees"</li>
<li>The other class stones around this year are located in the middle, grassy
area of campus</li>
<li>Stones around this time period were also basic and square shaped, so this
one may be the same.</li>
</ul>

	<h1>1895 Class Stone</h1>
	<div class = "item"></div>
	<div class ="item"><p>Just like 1894's stone, there aren't many clue towards its location, but here is what we do know:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>The ceremony was held next to "tall trees"</li>
<li>Just like before, the other class stones around this time period are located in the middle of campus</li>
<li>Also like before, this stone may be square shaped as well.

	<h1>Class Stone Photo?</h1>
	<div class = "item"> <img src ="IMG_1860.jpg"></div>
	<div class ="item"><p>If you look past the fence you can see a strange
object. Could this be a class stone? Stone from around this time period are 
located near Smythe Hall. Now you may ask "If it's a class stone, then
shouldn't it be covered in snow?" Well normally it should be, class stones
were more respected back then, so there's a chance that maybe people would
wipe snow off of the stones. But this is all just speculation. Your guess is
as good as mine.</p></div>
