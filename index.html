Inspected by military staff on campus. This inspection is day long. They inspect march-ins, hallways, uniforms, uniformity, rooms. This always stresses students out, but the SJNMA Corp of Cadets once again proved why they were Honor Unit with Distinction.</p></div>

  <div class="item"><p>Ralph Spanjer 'Smoke', became SJNMA president in 1994. Some of his ideas included merging NMNA and SJMA, enrolling 7th and 8th graders into the school so they could learn good habits from the older cadets. This would hopefully increase enrollment to 400 by the year 2000. U.S. President Bush came to SJNMA where he was presented by Spanjer's cadets. He stepped down to the Chancellor role in 1998.</p></div>

<h2>NMNA 1914-1930</h2>
<Div class= "Artifacts">
        <div class= "Artifact1">
<h3>In Saint Johns, back then we had another company other than
 just the Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, and Foxtrot, we
 had also had a car
corps but they had been dispanded shortly after WWII.
These car corps
 had consisted of multiple cars. These cars that they had were all made
 by Royal Page Davidson (BORN October 9, 1870, and he DIED on January
16, 1943) he had made many types of armored cars and had done tons of extensive
travels in his armored cars. He had made cadillacs into ballon destroyers with
 50 cal brownings on them that
 could swivel horizontal and verticaly 180 degrees.
One time when they were traveling with
 these cars they had gone right through a guys drive
 who was making all of the other cars drive through his ditch to show how
 much he disliked the idea of the cars, and he had let the3 SJNMNA pass
 right through his drive because he had seen the
 guns and the guns had scared him.

An Artifact that I can talk to you
 about is one of the cadillac ballon Destroyers
that Corporal Davidson had made. What he had made
 was he had taken the frame and engine of a cadillac,
 and then he had added extensive parts, like a 50 cal browning
 that had been able to move
 vertical and horizontal, 180 degrees, which had
 made that a good reason to get them.
The army had even started to enlist these vehicles
 during WWII because of how great
 they were wityh tracking on hard terrain. Sadly
 Corporal wasn't able to see this because he had passed away in 1943.

	<h4>1894 Class Stone</h4>
	<div class = "item"></div>
	<div class = "col-sm-3"><p>As one of the oldest recorded class stones in this schools
history, it's not surprising that it would have gone missing. We don't have many
clue as to its location, but here is what we do have:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>The ceremony was held under rustling trees</li>
<li>The other class stones around this year are located in the middle, grassy
area of campus</li>
<li>Stones around this time period were also basic and square shaped, so this
one may be the same.</li>

<ul>
<li>The ceremony was held next to tall trees</li>
<li>Just like before, the other class stones around this time period are located in the middle of campus</li>
<li>Also like before, this stone may be square shaped as well.</li>

	<h4>Class Stone Photo?</h4>
	<div class = "item"> <img src = "img/IMG_1860.jpg"></div>
	<div class = "col-sm-3"><p>If you look past the fence you can see a strange
object. Could this be a class stone? Stone from around this time period are 
located near Smythe Hall. Now you may ask "If it's a class stone, then
shouldn't it be covered in snow?" Well normally it should be, class stones
were more respected back then, so there's a chance that maybe people would
wipe snow off of the stones. But this is all just speculation. Your guess is
as good as mine.</p></div>
